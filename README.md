# Oh-my-bash custom dir backup

This repo contains my [oh-my-bash](https://ohmybash.github.io/) ([src](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash)) custom directory backup.

Mainly all definitions that before were in `.bashrc` and a custom theme (`jmrf`) changing a little the `$PS1`, the shell prompt.


## Restore

To restore, simply copy the entire repo in the `oh-my-bash` installation directory. (Usually `~/.oh-my-bash`)
